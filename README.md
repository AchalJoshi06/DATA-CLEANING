# DATA-CLEANING

Welcome to the **DATA-CLEANING** repository!

This repository showcases my approaches to data cleaning using tools such as **Excel**, **Power Query**, and **SQL**. Although Python is popular for data cleaning, my workflow primarily relies on these other powerful tools, which are widely used in business and analytics environments.

## Contents

- Sample projects and scripts for cleaning data using Excel formulas and features
- Power Query transformations and sample files
- SQL scripts for data profiling, cleansing, and transformation
- Documentation and tips for best practices in data cleaning

## Why Excel, Power Query, and SQL?

- **Excel:** Ideal for quick data profiling, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and using formulas for data transformation.
- **Power Query:** Powerful for automating complex transformation steps, merging datasets, and repeatable data pipelines within Excel or Power BI.
- **SQL:** Essential for working with larger datasets, especially in databases—great for filtering, joining, deduplication, and advanced data manipulation.
